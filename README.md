# ⬡ Joineazy — Assignment & Review Dashboard

A modern, role-based assignment management system built for the **Joineazy Frontend Intern – Round 2** task. Designed with a dark luxury aesthetic, clean component architecture, and full role-based workflows for students and professors.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Joineazy Dashboard** is a frontend-focused single-page application that simulates a real-world university assignment management system. It supports two primary roles:

- 🏛 **Professor (Admin)** — Create and manage courses & assignments, track student submissions
- 🎓 **Student** — View enrolled courses, acknowledge assignments, manage groups

All data is handled via `localStorage` with mock seed data — no backend required.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

- **Component-based architecture** — each component has a single responsibility
- **Pure CSS over frameworks** — full control, no Tailwind, uses CSS custom properties throughout
- **Dark luxury aesthetic** — deep navy base (`#05070f`), electric blue (`#5b8fff`), mint (`#00ddb3`)
- **Typography** — Syne (700–800 weight) for headings, Jost (300–600) for body text
- **Motion** — purposeful animations only: card entrance stagger, spring modals, blob float
- **Mobile-first responsive** — single column on mobile, expands to full grid on desktop
- **Accessibility** — keyboard navigable modals, sufficient colour contrast, focus states
