## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### State Management
- **App.jsx** owns all global state (`currentUser`, `assignments`)
- Data persists across refreshes via **localStorage**
- Props drilling used (no Context/Redux needed at this scale)

### Routing
- Single-page: App conditionally renders `<LoginPage>`, `<StudentDashboard>`, or `<AdminDashboard>` based on `currentUser`

### Data Layer
- No backend — `mockData.js` seeds initial data to `localStorage`
- `assignments` array holds submission state: each assignment has a `submissions: [studentId]` array

### Component Design Decisions
| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| `LoginPage` | Hero landing, role/user selection |
| `Navbar` | Sticky nav with tab switching, user badge, logout |
| `StudentDashboard` | Grid of assignment cards, stats, circular progress |
| `AssignmentCard` (inside Student) | Individual card with submit button |
| `AdminDashboard` | List of assignments with per-student progress bars |
| `AdminAssignmentCard` (inside Admin) | Card + expandable student list |
| `SubmitModal` | 2-step double-verification flow |
| `CreateAssignmentModal` | Form with validation for new assignments |
| `Toast` | Auto-dismissing notifications (3.5s) |
